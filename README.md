## 💡 Inspiration

This project originated from our **AWE Nexus stage-selected prototype**, where we experimented with **Gaussian Splatting** captured via mobile phones and allowed participants to join **only through VR headsets**. During that period, Zihao hosted **three live virtual tours of New York** using **360° images**, attracting **600+ international participants each session**, with engagement lasting **over 2.5 hours** each time.

These sessions revealed four critical insights:

1. **Social presence and human storytelling** matter far more than just visuals  
2. **Shift from 360 still-images → fully explorable Gaussian Splatting environments**  
3. **Move from VR-only → frictionless WebXR cross-platform access**  
4. **Design for high-engagement social interaction**, not passive viewing  

This became the foundation for the new evolution of **GrandTourXR** — an accessible, social, AI-enhanced platform for immersive cultural exploration.
